            Game notes: The Wolverines look to remain unbeaten as they welcome their in-state rival Spartans to the Big House. Last time these two teams met here, MSU was a three-touchdown underdog, yet pulled off a shocking 27-24 upset in Mel Tucker's second game as head coach â€” with no fans in the stands. MSU also won last year's epic showdown, 37-33, in East Lansing. Both teams had last week off.
